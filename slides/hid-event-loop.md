# Evented Architecture

##### Node.js uses events

- event-driven programming is application flow control that is determined by events or changes in state
- An entity that handles and processes external events and converts them into callback invocations
- First-class functions. E.g. we pass around functions as data, shuffle them around and execute them when needed.
- Function composition. Also known as having anonymous functions or closures that are executed after something happens in the evented I/O
